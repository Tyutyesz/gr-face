# Glass try on pod

It is a simple `javascript` pod for my own use.

## Getting started

After you cloned this repo, you have to run it on your `localhost` or have an HTTPS because Chrome will not allowing to
use your camera.

For face recognition, I used the [clmtrack.js](https://github.com/auduno/clmtrackr) combined with `jquery`.
